# 4090Fan-CCW-Bracket
This project is a 4090 fan bracket, which is suitable for the K04 suffix of the CCW rotation direction. This file contains the SolidWorks drawing (2022 version) of the bracket, the STL file required for printing, and the Gerber file and Bom list of the PCB board.
The SLDPRT file is a part file of SolidWorks. To open it, you need to use version 2022 and above to open it; users can use it to make further modifications, but they need to follow the open source agreement for use.
About the stl file is the file used by the 3D printer to slice, you can use your default parameters to print.
Gerber files are engineering files used for PCB manufacturing. The compressed package does not need to be decompressed, just upload the file to the corresponding PCB processor. It is recommended to use JLC-PCB service to print circuit boards.
Items that need to be purchased additionally: 8Pin 0.5mm pitch FPC connector, 2510 terminal, 4Pin cable, M2 screw.
